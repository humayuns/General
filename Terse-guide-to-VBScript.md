# Terse Guide to VBScript

## VBScript Functions
Built-in VBScript functions

## Here's a table summarizing the main features of VBScript:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data Types | VBScript supports several data types, including string, integer, double, boolean, and date. |
| Variables | Variables are used to store data values. They are declared using the Dim keyword. |
| Operators | VBScript supports arithmetic, comparison, logical, and concatenation operators. |
| Control Structures | VBScript supports several control structures, including if-then-else, select-case, do-while, do-until, for-next, and while-wend. |
| Functions and Subroutines | Functions and subroutines are used to encapsulate code and make it reusable. Functions return a value, while subroutines do not. |
| Error Handling | VBScript supports error handling using the on error statement. |
| Objects | VBScript supports object-oriented programming using built-in objects like FileSystemObject, Dictionary, and RegExp. |
| Input and Output | VBScript supports input and output using the WScript object, which provides methods for reading from and writing to the console. |
| Comments | Comments are used to document code and improve readability. They are denoted using the ' character. |

Note: VBScript is an outdated scripting language and is no longer actively developed or supported by Microsoft. It is recommended to use other scripting languages like PowerShell or JavaScript instead.
