# Question and Answers

## explain basics of pything using 5 code examples.

Sure, here are 5 basic Python code examples that explain some of the fundamental concepts of the language:

1. Hello World:

This is a simple program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

2. Variables:

In Python, you can assign values to variables using the "=" operator. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)
```

This program assigns the values 5 and 10 to the variables x and y, respectively. It then adds x and y together and assigns the result to the variable z. Finally, it prints the value of z to the console.

3. Conditional Statements:

Python supports if-else statements for conditional logic. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
```

This program assigns the value 5 to the variable x. It then checks if x is greater than 10 using an if statement. Since x is less than 10, the program executes the else block and prints "x is less than or equal to 10" to the console.

4. Loops:

Python supports for and while loops for iterating over sequences of data. Here's an example of a for loop:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

This program creates a list of fruits and then iterates over the list using a for loop. For each fruit in the list, it prints the name of the fruit to the console.

5. Functions:

Python allows you to define your own functions using the "def" keyword. Here's an example:

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 10)
print(result)
```

This program defines a function called "add_numbers" that takes two arguments and returns their sum. It then calls the function with the arguments 5 and 10 and assigns the result to the variable "result". Finally, it prints the value of result to the console.

## write list of main python features in a table

Sure, here's a table listing some of the main features of Python:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to Learn | Python has a simple syntax and is easy to learn for beginners. |
| Interpreted | Python is an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed directly without the need for compilation. |
| Object-Oriented | Python supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of reusable code and modular programs. |
| Dynamic Typing | Python is dynamically typed, which means that variable types are determined at runtime. |
| Cross-Platform | Python code can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. |
| Large Standard Library | Python comes with a large standard library that provides many useful modules and functions for common tasks. |
| Third-Party Libraries | Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries that can be easily installed and used in projects. |
| High-Level Language | Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away low-level details and provides a simpler interface for programming. |
| Garbage Collection | Python has automatic garbage collection, which means that memory management is handled by the interpreter. |
| Exception Handling | Python has built-in support for exception handling, which allows for graceful error handling and recovery. |
